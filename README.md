# Gifts Den

Gits den aims to be the one stop shop for all the gifts you need, for those special people in your life!

The wide scope name of the store was very much deliberate, in the sense that it gives potentially limitless rooms for expansion in the future, both in terms of prodct range and store size.

When building the store, I started off with some clothing, electrical and living style products, with the intension of expanding this in the future.

Please see the wireframes shots below to give you an idea of the general site layout and structure.

## User stories/planning

I used Github's storyboard feature to assist me with the planning of this project, although, as with previous projects, I did need to add some stories while building the project to cater for additional features such as reviews, that I decieded to add after commencing work.

## Models

The project includes all Crud functionality as per requirements.

The main models within the project are:

Products consisting of:
- Category
- Product
- Review 
- Userprofile

- The Review model is an addition to the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough project, which I used to help me build this project.

- I will also be ammending or possibly removing the rating field from the product model, as a user is unable to rate a project in it's current form and believe that the review model is more useful in this regard.

- I also added a date of birth field to the Userprofile model as I believe this will be useful in terms of any age restricted products that may be sold on the store in the future.
